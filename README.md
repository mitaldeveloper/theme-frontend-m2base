# M2base

## Installation

```
composer require gpmd/theme-frontend-m2base dev-master
```

Then register the theme in `tools/dev/themes.js` (see `docs/frontend-build.md` for more info).

## Frontend Build

See `docs/frontend-build.md`.

## Legacy Build

The `Gruntfile.js` and `package.json` files in this module have been left in place for our older sites that haven&#8217;t been migrated to the new Grunt workflow.

All the grunt configs in this theme&#8217;s `grunt` directory include the legacy task config and new task config.
